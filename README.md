## What is this? 

Many night before bed, after books are read and teeth are brushed, my son (3) will pause, look a bit pensive, and say, "Something that hurt me...", following up with something he doesn't like. 

It's a classic bed-time stalling maneuver. The general counter is that I ask him for something else that makes him feel good. 

The answers are generally charming though, and I'm building a site to celebrate this fleeting moment in his young life.

## Why are you doing this though?

I've been curious about Gatsby & GraphQL, so I'm going to build out this site in Gatsby and then build out a slightly overkill backend server that will allow me to CRUD entries.

It's really just an excuse to explore the framework a bit more.
